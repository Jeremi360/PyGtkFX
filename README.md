Small lib to make Gtk my way.
I use it in my [cRoWBaR project][3]

If you won to use this your python apps will need:
- [python version 3.x][1]
- Gtk and Webkit from gi repository:
   - Linux check your dist repos
   - [Windows][2] - download "pygi-aio-*-setup.exe"

Done:

* AboutDialog
* some small fixes to Window and Builder
* Notebook was forked from https://github.com/zepto/webbrowser

ToDo:

* Add more automation to Builder class
